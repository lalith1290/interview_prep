# DevOps Interview Questions and Answers

## AWS

### 1. AWS services used in DevOps
AWS offers numerous services that support DevOps practices:
- **CodePipeline**: Continuous delivery service
- **CodeBuild**: Fully managed build service
- **CodeDeploy**: Automated deployment service
- **CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as code
- **CodeCommit**: Git-based version control

- **Systems Manager**: Configuration management
- **ECR**: Container registry


### 2. What happens if we forget the public key of an EC2 instance?
If you lose access to your EC2 instance because you've lost the key pair:
1. Stop (don't terminate) the instance
2. Detach the root EBS volume
3. Attach this volume to another EC2 instance as a secondary volume
4. Mount the volume, modify the authorized_keys file with a new key
5. Detach the volume, reattach to the original instance
6. Start the original instance and connect using the new key

Alternatively, for Amazon Linux 2 or Amazon Linux AMI, you can use EC2 Instance Connect or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager if configured.

### 3. What are security groups?
Security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances that control inbound and outbound traffic. Key characteristics:
- Act at the instance level (not subnet level like NACLs)
- Support allow rules only (no explicit deny rules)
- Are stateful (return traffic is automatically allowed)
- Filter traffic based on protocols and port ranges
- Can reference other security groups or IP ranges
- Can be attached to multiple instances

### 4. What is RDS?
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. RDS provides:
- Automated backups and patching
- High availability with Multi-AZ deployment
- Read replicas for read scalability
- Supports multiple database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora
- Automated failover capability
- Easy scaling of compute and storage resources

### 5. How to connect EC2 instances to the local machine
To connect to EC2 instances from your local machine:

**For Linux/Unix instances:**
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@instance-public-ip
```

**For Windows instances:**
- Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client
- You'll need the public IP address and the administrator password

**Alternative methods:**
- AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (no need for open ports)
- EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based)
- SSH through a bastion host for private instances

### 6. What is the difference between a public and private subnet?
**Public subnet:**
- Has a route to an Internet Gateway in its route table
- Resources can receive inbound connections from the internet
- Resources can initiate outbound connections to the internet
- Usually contains resources that need to be accessible from the internet (web servers, load balancers)

**Private subnet:**
- Has no direct route to an Internet Gateway
- Resources cannot receive unsolicited inbound connections from the internet
- Resources can access the internet via a NAT Gateway/Instance (if configured)
- Usually contains resources that should not be directly accessible from the internet (databases, application servers)

### 7. S3 bucket globally rename it or not?
S3 bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts and regions. Once a bucket is created, you cannot rename it. To "rename" a bucket, you must:
1. Create a new bucket with the desired name
2. Copy/move all objects from the old bucket to the new one
3. Update references to point to the new bucket
4. Delete the old bucket if no longer needed

### 8. How to access the internet in a private subnet?
To allow resources in a private subnet to access the internet:
1. Create a NAT Gateway (or NAT Instance) in a public subnet
2. Update the route table associated with the private subnet to direct internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT Gateway
3. Ensure the NAT Gateway has an Elastic IP address
4. Verify security groups allow outbound traffic

The NAT Gateway translates the private IP addresses to public ones for outbound traffic while preventing inbound connections.

### 9. What are default settings of security groups?
Default settings for a newly created security group:
- All outbound traffic is allowed (0.0.0.0/0)
- No inbound traffic is allowed
- The security group is stateful (return traffic is automatically allowed)

The default security group created with a new VPC has:
- Inbound rules allowing traffic from other resources assigned to the same security group
- All outbound traffic allowed

### 10. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Working methodology
Elastic Load Balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, improving availability and fault tolerance. Working methodology:
1. **Traffic Reception**: ELB receives requests from clients
2. **Health Checking**: Continuously monitors registered targets
3. **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic using algorithms (round-robin by default)
4. **Scaling**: Automatically scales to handle traffic load
5. **Isolation**: Serves as a security boundary between internet and private network

AWS offers three types of load balancers:
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: HTTP/HTTPS traffic, layer 7
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: TCP/UDP traffic, layer 4, ultra-low latency
- **Classic Load Balancer**: Legacy, both layer 4 and basic layer 7

### 11. Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) uses
Auto Scaling Groups are used to:
- Ensure application availability by maintaining a specified number of instances
- Automatically increase capacity during demand spikes
- Automatically decrease capacity during low demand periods
- Replace unhealthy instances automatically
- Balance instances across multiple Availability Zones
- Integrate with ELB for balanced traffic distribution
- Scale based on various metrics (CPU, memory, custom metrics)
- Schedule scaling for predictable load changes
- Reduce costs by optimizing resource usage

### 12. EBS: How to mount volume in instance
To mount an EBS volume in an EC2 instance:

**For Linux:**
1. Attach the volume to your instance via AWS Console or CLI
2. Connect to your instance via SSH
3. Check available disks:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
4. If new volume is unformatted, create a file system:
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
   ```
5. Create a mount point:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /data
   ```
6. Mount the volume:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
   ```
7. For persistent mounting (survives reboot), add to /etc/fstab:
   ```bash
   echo '/dev/xvdf /data xfs defaults,nofail 0 2' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   ```

**For Windows:**
1. Attach the volume
2. Use Disk Management utility to bring the disk online, initialize, and format it
3. Assign a drive letter

    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  tags = {
    Name = "web-sg"
  }
}
```

This configuration creates:
- A VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
- Public and private subnets in different AZs
- Internet Gateway for public internet access
- NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access
- Route tables with appropriate routes

  - Session duration (how long credentials last)
- **Benefits**:
  - No embedded credentials in applications
  - Centralized permission management
  - Temporary credential security
  - Delegation of access

### 47. Amazon EBS-backed vs. instance-store backed instances
**EBS-backed Instances:**
- Root volume is an EBS volume
- Data persists after instance termination (by default)
- Can be stopped and restarted (retain same instance ID)
- Can be resized and have storage characteristics modified
- Backed up via snapshots
- Better availability (separate from instance)
- Slower provisioning (need to create/attach volumes)
- Most modern EC2 instance types support only EBS

**Instance-store Backed Instances:**
- Root volume is an instance store (physically attached to host)
- Data lost when instance terminates or underlying hardware fails
- Cannot be stopped, only terminated or rebooted
- Fixed storage size (determined by instance type)
- No persistent backup option (must handle manually)
- Higher I/O performance (direct hardware access)
- Faster provisioning (pre-allocated storage)
- Limited to instance types that support instance store

### 48. AWS EC2 Instance types

- Provides high availability within an Availability Zone
- Handles up to 55,000 simultaneous connections per NAT gateway
- Scales automatically up to 45 Gbps
- Managed by AWS (no maintenance required)
- Provides better availability than NAT instances
- Can be associated with security groups
- Requires an Elastic IP address
- Operates at the transport layer (layer 4)
- Common uses include software updates, API calls to AWS services, external database connections

### 51. The pem key is lost, and I need to connect via SSH
If you've lost the .pem key for an EC2 instance, you can regain SSH access by:

**For Amazon Linux, RHEL, Ubuntu, and similar:**
1. Stop the instance (don't terminate)
2. Detach the root volume
3. Attach the volume to another instance as a secondary volume
4. Mount the volume on the temporary instance
5. Modify the `authorized_keys` file:
   ```bash
   # On temporary instance
   mkdir -p /mnt/tempvol
   mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/tempvol  # Adjust device name as needed
   
   # Create a new key pair
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f mynewkey
   
   # Update authorized_keys with new public key
   cat mynewkey.pub >> /mnt/tempvol/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
   
   # Unmount and detach
   umount /mnt/tempvol
   ```
6. Detach the volume from temporary instance
7. Reattach to the original instance
8. Start the original instance
9. Connect using the new private key

**Alternative Methods:**
- Use EC2 Instance Connect (if available for your instance type/AMI)
- Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (if installed)
- Use AWS Backup/AMI to launch a new instance with the same data and a new key

### 52. Connect to a private subnet via SSH from a local machine
To connect to an EC2 instance in a private subnet via SSH from a local machine:

**Method 1: Bastion Host**
1. Launch a bastion host (jump box) in a public subnet
2. Configure security groups:
   - Bastion: Allow SSH from your IP
   - Private instance: Allow SSH from bastion security group
3. Connect through the bastion:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: SSH agent forwarding
   ssh-add your-key.pem
   ssh -A ec2-user@bastion-public-ip
   ssh ec2-user@private-instance-ip
   
   # Option 2: ProxyJump (OpenSSH 7.3+)
   ssh -J ec2-user@bastion-public-ip ec2-user@private-instance-ip -i your-key.pem
   
   # Option 3: SSH config file
   # Add to ~/.ssh/config:
   # Host bastion
   #   HostName bastion-public-ip
   #   User ec2-user
   #   IdentityFile /path/to/key.pem
   # 
   # Host private-instance
   #   HostName private-instance-ip
   #   User ec2-user
   #   ProxyJump bastion
   #   IdentityFile /path/to/key.pem
   ```

**Method 2: Systems Manager Session Manager**
1. Ensure the SSM Agent is installed on the private instance
2. Attach an IAM role with AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy
3. Connect through AWS Console or CLI:
   ```bash
   aws ssm start-session --target instance-id
   ```

**Method 3: VPN Connection**
1. Set up AWS Client VPN or Site-to-Site VPN
2. Connect your local network to the VPC
3. SSH directly to the private IP address

### 53. Connectivity between two VPCs in private subnets
To establish connectivity between resources in private subnets of two different VPCs:

**Method 1: VPC Peering**
1. Create a VPC peering connection between the two VPCs
2. Accept the peering connection request
3. Update route tables in both VPCs to route traffic to the peered VPC's CIDR
4. Configure security groups to allow traffic between instances
5. Ensure no overlapping CIDR blocks between VPCs

**Method 2: AWS Transit Gateway**
1. Create a Transit Gateway
2. Attach both VPCs to the Transit Gateway
3. Configure route tables in the Transit Gateway
4. Update VPC route tables to direct traffic to the Transit Gateway
5. Better for connecting multiple VPCs (hub and spoke model)

**Method 3: AWS PrivateLink**
1. Create a VPC Endpoint Service in one VPC
2. Create an Interface VPC Endpoint in the other VPC
3. Good for exposing specific services rather than full network connectivity

**Method 4: Software VPN**
1. Deploy VPN appliances in each VPC
2. Configure routing between the VPCs via the VPN connection

Each approach has different cost, scalability, and bandwidth considerations.

### 54. AutoScaling in AWS why?
AWS Auto Scaling is used for several key reasons:
- **High Availability**: Automatically replaces unhealthy instances
- **Fault Tolerance**: Distributes instances across multiple Availability Zones

- **Automatic Resource Management**: Responds to changing demand without manual intervention
- **Predictable Scaling**: Can schedule scaling actions for known traffic patterns
- **Application Resilience**: Prevents application downtime from instance failures
- **Traffic Handling**: Manages varying levels of traffic effectively
- **Right-sizing**: Maintains appropriate capacity for workload
- **Elasticity**: Adapts to both expected and unexpected changes in demand
- **Simplified Fleet Management**: Automated management of instance fleets

### 55. What is meant by IAM server?
The term "IAM server" is not a standard AWS term, but likely refers to:

1. **IAM service** in AWS, which is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS resources. IAM is not a server itself but a global service that manages:
   - Users, groups, and roles
   - Access policies and permissions
   - Identity federation
   - Multi-factor authentication

2. **Identity server** or **identity provider** that integrates with AWS IAM, such as:
   - Active Directory
   - LDAP servers
   - SAML 2.0 providers (Okta, OneLogin, etc.)
   - Custom identity management solutions

3. **IAM role-enabled server**, which refers to an EC2 instance or other compute resource that has an IAM role attached, allowing it to access AWS services without storing credentials.

The correct meaning depends on the context of the question.

### 56. What do you mean by AMI in a server?
AMI (Amazon Machine Image) in the context of a server refers to:
- A pre-configured template used to create EC2 instances
- Contains the operating system, application server, and applications
- Defines the initial state of an instance when launched
- Can be AWS-provided, community-created, marketplace, or custom
- Includes the root volume configuration and block device mappings
- Region-specific resource (must be copied between regions)
- Can be shared across AWS accounts
- Used for consistent deployments and scaling
- Enables backup and disaster recovery strategies
- Serves as a baseline for server deployments
- Can include pre-installed software and configurations
- Often used in launch templates and Auto Scaling groups

### 7. Difference between top and nice commands
**top**:
- A process monitoring utility that displays system summary and list of processes
- Shows CPU usage, memory usage, load average, and process details
- Interactive tool with sorting and filtering capabilities
- Provides real-time view of system performance
- Used primarily for monitoring and troubleshooting
- Can be used to send signals to processes (kill, renice)
- Common options: `top -c` (command with arguments), `top -u user` (specific user's processes)

**nice**:
- A command that adjusts the scheduling priority of a new process
- Changes the "niceness" value of a process (ranges from -20 to 19)
- Lower values get higher priority (-20 is highest priority, 19 is lowest)
- Only root can set negative nice values
- Used to control CPU resource allocation
- Syntax: `nice -n [priority] [command]`
- Example: `nice -n 10 ./cpu_intensive_script.sh` (runs at lower priority)

**Key differences**:
- `top` is a monitoring tool; `nice` sets process priorities
- `top` operates on existing processes; `nice` is used when starting a new process
- There's also `renice` command to change priority of an already running process

### 8. Command to check server load
Commands to check server load in Linux:

**Primary tools**:
- `uptime` - Shows load averages for 1, 5, and 15 minutes
- `top` - Interactive process viewer with system load information
- `htop` - Enhanced version of top with better UI and features
- `w` - Displays system uptime, load averages, and logged-in users

**Additional monitoring tools**:
- `vmstat` - Virtual memory statistics and system activities
- `sar` - Collect and report system activity information
- `iostat` - CPU and I/O statistics for devices and partitions
- `mpstat` - Multiple processor usage
- `dstat` - Versatile resource statistics tool
- `glances` - Cross-platform monitoring tool with web interface option

**For specific resources**:
- CPU: `mpstat`, `sar -u`
- Memory: `free -m`, `vmstat`, `sar -r`
- Disk I/O: `iostat`, `sar -d`
- Network: `sar -n DEV`, `netstat`, `iftop`

**Example output interpretation**:
```
$ uptime
 15:30:03 up 5 days,  6:05,  3 users,  load average: 1.05, 0.70, 0.48
```
Load averages represent the number of processes waiting for CPU time. Values under the number of CPU cores indicate the system is handling the load well.

### 9. How to rename a file in Linux?
To rename a file in Linux:

**Using mv command** (most common):
```bash
mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt
```

**Using rename command** (for batch renaming with regex):
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu syntax (perl-based)
rename 's/\.txt$/\.md/' *.txt  # Change all .txt files to .md

# CentOS/RHEL syntax (util-linux version)
rename .txt .md *.txt  # Change all .txt files to .md
```

**Using cp and rm** (alternative approach):
```bash
cp oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt
rm oldfilename.txt
```

**For GUI environments**:
- Right-click the file and select "Rename"
- Use file manager (Nautilus, Dolphin, etc.)

**Considerations**:
- Preserve file permissions with `mv`
- Be careful with spaces in filenames (use quotes or escape with backslash)
- Check for existing files to avoid overwriting
